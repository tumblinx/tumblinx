I'm a current Computer Science student at Ohio University. I love learning about a lot of different stuff, not just within Computer Science such as physics, math, biology, etc. Pretty much any area within STEM lol.

## About me
My computer science journey started when I was in high school, where I had started studying IT and received a few CompTIA certifications like Network+, Server+, A+, and ITF+. This was a lot of fun and got me excited about the area but I knew I wanted to take it to the next level and dive deeper into how these systems work. This led me here to Ohio University, although the beautiful campus and it's long history also played a huge role in why I came here lol.

## Current me
Currently I am in my Junior Year (Spring 2026) and am taking classes in Compilers, Distributed and Parallel computing, Data Communications, Calculus III, and Rome under the Caesars.

In my free time I love tinkering with linux and would love to get more involved in some Open Source projects.
